            " Okay, perfect. Well it's nice to meet you. My name is Amira. I am also based in the United States, and I've been on wrinkle for about a month now, and I've had some really good experiences so hopefully we have a good experience today I think we will.\n",
            " Just before we begin, we'll be doing a paraphrasing focus lesson. And then like you said to focus on pronunciation and then also fluency. And you said to try to make it sound more native.\n",
            " And yeah, do you have any questions or anything before we begin the lesson, you know that.\n",
            " In the end of the lesson I wanted to have a four or three word.\n",
            " Okay. Yeah. Um, so, are you saying like two or three words that you're using very frequently.\n",
            " No, no, which is used frequently in common conversation, I want to. Oh yeah yeah of course of course. Okay, so like phrases, for example. Okay.\n",
            " Yeah, absolutely. Um, so hopefully we can use some of these today and then we can have them by the end of it.\n",
            " And yeah, okay so we are doing the great resignation lesson. And so usually how I'll do this is I'll ask you a question, and then after the question we can paraphrase together and come up with.\n",
            " I don't know maybe a nicer way to say it.\n",
            " Good.\n",
            " Yeah, I have.\n",
            " Perfect. Okay, so question one. And so have you thought about changing your job since the pandemic.\n",
            " Yeah, definitely. You know, I have two keys. One is 14 years old and we look for the high school. And the second one is post grading elementary school.\n",
            " But the problem is in is a lot of money.\n",
            " And therefore the tutoring. After I moved here in case of Korea, it is more convenient to sending them to the tuition center, it is very well systemized you know.\n",
            " And they usually having a shuttle bus.\n",
            " And to the tuition center, even the tuition centers is, you know, located in the very similar location in the same building whole whole 15 buildings are tuition center.\n",
            " So it's more easy and the cheaper but here you know it is hard to find the tutor and the very expensive and I have to realize for this reason you know I tried to have another job.\n",
            " Maybe later, because I'm still under no green card processing so I cannot move yet.\n",
            " No, that makes sense.\n",
            " Um,\n",
            " I think the most common thing is that there's a shuttle bus from home to the tuition center, or the tuition to the tutoring center, that's not common at all here.\n",
            " Unfortunately, yes.\n",
            " Um, but yeah okay so we can do some paraphrasing here so you said definitely.\n",
            " I'm sure. I'm definitely, I have two kids.\n",
            " So here we could say, since I have two kids, and then we could say like a 14 year old, and a fourth grade, like nine year old.\n",
            " And I have to spend a lot of money on tutoring.\n",
            " So I would make sure.\n",
            " It's important.\n",
            " Um, okay.\n",
            " Or I guess you could say one is 14 years old, but yeah, this is good. Okay, so spend a lot of money on tutoring for them. Um, so then you said, in the case of Korea so here I would actually say, like,\n",
            " maybe like in regard to tutoring.\n",
            " Um, it is much more convenient to send my children to, or even.\n",
            " What do we say here.\n",
            " Yes, to send my children to the tutoring center in Korea.\n",
            " And then we could say like this is because I'm tutor tutoring center.\n",
            " It's located in a very similar.\n",
            " So when you're saying it's located in a very similar location.\n",
            " It's located in a very similar location to what exactly they are gathered, they are gathered like the one for each child is close. Okay.\n",
            " And then the tutoring centers for different ages are located, and then we could say, very similarly because yeah close by that's really good yeah close by located close by.\n",
            " It is more easy and cheaper but here. Okay. So usually, I would recommend. So, here so if you were to say more easy.\n",
            " I think that typically we would just say easier, just like how you said cheaper.\n",
            " Rather than saying more cheap, we say cheaper, which is what you did, but I would keep that consistent for pretty much every word, so we would say it's not that it's wrong, by the way, to say more easy, it just sounds, sir to say easier.\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " So, it is easier and cheaper.\n",
            " No, it's easier and cheaper in Korea.\n",
            " But in the United States.\n",
            " Like, it can be difficult to find a tutor, and very expensive.\n",
            " Very expensive.\n",
            " For this reason, I might try to take another job later.\n",
            " So yes, I know that you made a note here to the tuition center tutoring center. So, tuition would usually be like what you pay to, for example, what you pay to attend college, or what you pay to attend if you go to a private school.\n",
            " So that's what tuition is.\n",
            " And then, obviously that's different than tutoring which you know, it's a noun.\n",
            " So you pay the tuition.\n",
            " There's no.\n",
            " I don't think there's an adjective or a verb. I think that is just tuition so like you wouldn't say I'm like to to it or something that's not that's not a word you would just say pay tuition.\n",
            " Second, like for example, you pay tuition to attend\n",
            " kind of curating p right.\n",
            " What was it curating p.\n",
            " I'm not exactly there. There are two separate things. They sound really similar but they are different.\n",
            " Um, yes.\n",
            " I would necessarily say that we pay tuition for tutoring tuition is usually considered like something you would pay for a year or a semester, but usually with tutoring you would pay by the hour or like by the lesson.\n",
            " So it's a little bit different.\n",
            " Okay.\n",
            " So, tuition p and the tutoring, it is a different, different.\n",
            " I'm sorry, the expression tuition p and the tutoring. Oh, um, yes. So, yeah, I think, I mean tuition fee for sure yes. So, tuition fee is definitely a phrase tutoring fee.\n",
            " Yeah, that makes sense too. But I think it's important to note that they are different things.\n",
            " So yes. Does that make sense.\n",
            " Okay, good to know. Yes. Okay, is that, is that clear. Yeah. Okay, perfect, perfect. Um, and then yes, let me see if there's any other big things to note here.\n",
            " Um, so yeah so you highlighted in regard to I think that some phrases like that are really nice to have transitions between your sentences.\n",
            " So, yeah, that's one example. I'll underline this as well and I'll try to underline them throughout the lesson too so we can keep track of them.\n",
            " Um, and yeah, do you have any other questions here or do you need any clarification on any changes that I made. No, no, no, no.\n",
            " And can I can I read the correct sentence and of course. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. Yes. Okay.\n",
            " Yes, definitely. Since I have two kids 14 year old and nine year old. I have to spend a lot of money on touring for them.\n",
            " In regard to touring. It is much more convenient to send my children to the touring center in Korea.\n",
            " Because the touring center for different ages are located close by.\n",
            " It is easier and cheaper in Korea, but in the United States. It can be difficult to find a tutor and very expensive.\n",
            " Paul for this reason, I might try to take another job later.\n",
            " Okay. Um, if I'm being honest, I don't know why people would have trouble understanding you because I think it's very easy to understand you.\n",
            " Um, but some, I noticed two things that could be improved upon.\n",
            " So one of them is when you're saying plurals, I think sometimes you pronounce the S, but I didn't hear it two times, which was when you said centers and United States, I didn't hear that.\n",
            " So I would be careful with that.\n",
            " But you did say two kids. So I know that you know to say it and you definitely said it sometimes but yeah I would just try to stay consistent. And then the other thing was with the F.\n",
            " So, I would make sure it's like, you're really kind of being, I don't want to say forceful but it's, it's kind of an aggressive sound like.\n",
            " And you were doing it kind of softly and it sounded almost like a bee. So, that's something that I would focus on the pronunciation of.\n",
            " So,\n",
            " no, I totally I understand.\n",
            " It's really hard to train your mouth to pronounce sounds that you are not like used to pronouncing so completely I understand.\n",
            " So, I'll just make a note here so far.\n",
            " What I've noticed. And then we can move on to another question if you are ready.\n",
            " Okay.\n",
            " Question two. Um, okay. So, is there a great resignation happening where you're from, and if so what's the similarities and differences between your country and the US.\n",
            " Okay, this is great question. And in Korea, there are no greater resignation.\n",
            " The thing is that the flexibility of the worker market is totally different from Korea and United States.\n",
            " Okay, to clarify the flexibility of what was the word you use work on a job market.\n",
            " Ah, the job market. Okay.\n",
            " It is totally different. Okay.\n",
            " Yeah, totally different.\n",
            " In the United States and Korea.\n",
            " Okay, could you explain that a little more.\n",
            " Okay, you know, the. In my opinion, United States has more job opening, and they don't care about the ages and background.\n",
            " But in Korea, it is a little bit different you know that corporate doesn't prefer the older people.\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " And the other reason is you know, there are some different culture, I can say that Korean companies, more like a bossy.\n",
            " In the United States, if I working for the engineer, I can be your engineer until the old ages.\n",
            " I can continue to focus on the engineering but in case of Korea, you know, around the 40 years, you know, the engineer should be promoted to the main.\n",
            " And the old people cannot have cannot sharpen their skills and the can lose their, you know, expertise.\n",
            " So, then you know they cannot get a job, you know, without expertise.\n",
            " Okay.\n",
            " That does sound very different.\n",
            " But there are actually like a lot of laws in the United States against discriminating against people based on age.\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " Yeah, here is the same in Korea.\n",
            " Yeah, I think it's very different for sure. Do you think that there's been any change, like with Westernization at all, towards becoming more like the United States, or do you think it's been the same for a really long time in Korea.\n",
            " Can you say, Yeah, of course. So I was asking, do you think that there's been a change in Korea and work culture, coming from Westernization from the United States, or do you think, Yes, they are being changes, they are being okay.\n",
            " Small companies, especially like a setup.\n",
            " Especially like startup company.\n",
            " Startup startup startup. Yes, yes, yes.\n",
            " That makes sense.\n",
            " They are benchmarking big IT company, such as Facebook, Facebook, like that, you know, based on the learning they try to be changing.\n",
            " It is not easy. It is not easy, you know, because their parents, they learn from the parents. And in their mind that they still have some bossy and hierarchical mind.\n",
            " But they are being changed.\n",
            " Is it content? Is that what you said?\n",
            " Or is it like a hierarchical mind?\n",
            " Okay.\n",
            " Interesting. Yes. Okay, so we can do some paraphrasing now, or I ask too many questions. Um, maybe I might do it one piece at a time, just because it's a little bit easier for me that way.\n",
            " So here, you can say, in Korea, this is this was a perfect way to start it.\n",
            " There are even outside there is no GR, or great resignation. Just because the question was formatted as in like a singular like is there a great resignation so we could say there is no, there is no great resignation.\n",
            " And then he said the reason for this is the flexibility of job market is totally different between the US and Korea.\n",
            " And so we could say the job market is much more flexible in the US, compared to Korea.\n",
            " I'm just changing the format of the sentence, a little bit to make it sound more fluent.\n",
            " And then I like how you said in my opinion, because I think a lot of times, I think we kind of default to saying, I think, and it's not necessarily super formal.\n",
            " And a better alternative is in my opinion or I believe, or I'm under the impression, things like that so this was really good.\n",
            " But in my opinion, to say the US, and making sure we're saying the US has more job openings.\n",
            " I think there were a couple times here where I didn't hear the S pronounced for the plural, so careful with that.\n",
            " And don't care about.\n",
            " In my opinion, the US has more job openings and they don't care. They don't care as much about age and background of potential employees.\n",
            " But in Korea,\n",
            " they are, say like very particular about this.\n",
            " So I think that it's nice to say as much here, because we're comparing the United States and Korea. So if we're just saying like they don't care about age and background okay but compared to what, so they don't care as much as compared to how much Koreans care.\n",
            " Yes.\n",
            " So we said corporate doesn't prefer.\n",
            " So you could say hiring older employees.\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " And the other reason is there are different job cultures. So we can say corporate doesn't prefer hiring older employees, and the work we can say workplace culture maybe differs tremendously.\n",
            " Between these countries.\n",
            " Are you familiar with this word tremendously. Yeah, it's not like, I don't know it's not like a complicated vocab word but it is kind of hard to say.\n",
            " So tremendously between these cultures, or between these countries.\n",
            " Korean companies are more bossy.\n",
            " So then maybe we can have a transition since we were talking about culture and differences in countries here we could say something like, based on the, you could say like, I don't know, based on like Korea's past or like Confucianism or like something about\n",
            " like hierarchies ingrained into the culture. That's why Korean companies are more bossy something like that.\n",
            " She could say like based on Korean culture and values.\n",
            " We could say bosses in Korea tend to be more bossy.\n",
            " Or even like companies in Korea.\n",
            " We said hierarchy, hierarchy, or companies in Korea tend to be more higher higher.\n",
            " Hierarchical.\n",
            " So, have you used this phrase before tend to. Yeah, I'm using it very frequently. Okay, perfect. That's a really good one.\n",
            " I would have suggested this probably at the end if you didn't use it already. I think that we use it pretty frequently in English.\n",
            " And he said in the US.\n",
            " I can be an engineer until the old ages. So, I would say something like, I can like maintain my position as an engineer.\n",
            " You could say indefinitely.\n",
            " So, meaning like forever basically without an end, you don't have an end.\n",
            " Yeah. So, pronunciation wise.\n",
            " Oh wait, I'm not there yet. Let me do the other half. But do you have any questions before I start the other half of this. No, I feel there is very funny.\n",
            " I mean that, you know, I can understand the one you wrote.\n",
            " And I cannot think about it when I try to talk or when I try to write. Totally. I understand. I think that with learning languages I think the first step is kind of is just taking all the information in and listening to what other people are saying.\n",
            " And eventually you're able to repeat it as well. But obviously it takes a minute. It's not, it's not instant like that but it will happen I promise it will happen.\n",
            " Okay. Yes, it will, it will.\n",
            " One step at a time.\n",
            " So here, so you said in the case of Korea around 40 years the engineer. Okay.\n",
            " Yeah, in the case of Korea, I like that.\n",
            " But then here again, I would say, I would say at around 40 years old.\n",
            " Yes, so first at the second, make sure you say years old.\n",
            " So, at around 40 years old.\n",
            " Engineers are\n",
            " usually promoted to manager, or even to manager positions.\n",
            " So old people cannot sharpen their skills and those are expertise. Okay.\n",
            " So then we can say, like, this makes it difficult\n",
            " for people, exactly, to sharpen their skills that was really good sharpen their skills.\n",
            " And causes\n",
            " to lose their expert.\n",
            " So here's a pronunciation thing expertise is how I would say it. Yes.\n",
            " Yeah, I like this.\n",
            " expertise.\n",
            " Where is the accent expertise expert. Good question.\n",
            " Yeah, I think that's a good question.\n",
            " Yeah, I think that's a good question.\n",
            " Yeah, I think that's a good question.\n",
            " Yeah, I think that's a good question.\n",
            " Yeah, I think that's a good question.\n",
            " Yeah, I think that's a good question.\n",
            " Yeah, I think that's a good question.\n",
            " Yeah, I think that's a good question.\n",
            " Yeah, I think that's a good question.\n",
            " Okay, so, um, hmm.\n",
            " So here's where we might be able to introduce like a transition word like recently.\n",
            " Listen, listen toward.\n",
            " We could say like toward Western style companies or something like that.\n",
            " Toward, like, maybe like Western Western values maybe toward Western values.\n",
            " So yes, recently, this is a good transition word here.\n",
            " Companies are shifting toward Western values.\n",
            " And so you said small companies, especially like startup companies, companies, we could say, like, recently, a small company.\n",
            " Especially startup companies, or even especially startups.\n",
            " Yeah, we could say, like, startups.\n",
            " We didn't. Yeah, pronunciation. Yes, totally.\n",
            " So startups.\n",
            " Wait, could you say it one more time?\n",
            " Startup.\n",
            " Okay. See now it sounds fine to me.\n",
            " So start, start.\n",
            " Yeah, I think, like, start, start.\n",
            " I don't know exactly what the, what the problem was and I heard it now.\n",
            " Yes, I think, yes, I don't know, I don't know what part of it was wrong though.\n",
            " Startup.\n",
            " Start. So I think it's that this part should be accentuated startup.\n",
            " Startup.\n",
            " Startup.\n",
            " Like, for example, how would you pronounce this word?\n",
            " Arts. Yeah, exactly. So like start.\n",
            " It's hard to say.\n",
            " I'm trying to hear it, but I would say just practice on it.\n",
            " Maybe you can research if there's a better phonetic spelling of it.\n",
            " And you know, if I have a differentiation teacher.\n",
            " I don't know.\n",
            " Perfect. Okay.\n",
            " Well then yes.\n",
            " Start up.\n",
            " Okay.\n",
            " So toward Western values.\n",
            " Where are we?\n",
            " So.\n",
            " These companies.\n",
            " Are.\n",
            " Benchmarking.\n",
            " These companies.\n",
            " Is that what you said? Benchmark thing.\n",
            " I didn't say.\n",
            " I don't know.\n",
            " It looks good.\n",
            " It looks good, but I don't know if it's the right word.\n",
            " I was just trusting.\n",
            " Actually it is.\n",
            " I think so. Okay.\n",
            " Or even say.\n",
            " The company tried to learn long.\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " The big company, but.\n",
            " Benchmarking.\n",
            " There is.\n",
            " I don't know if this is.\n",
            " To be honest.\n",
            " I don't know if I would use that there.\n",
            " I don't know if I would use that there, if I'm being honest,\n",
            " but it is kind of a nice word.\n",
            " I'll put that here.\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " So here I would actually say emulating.\n",
            " Emulating.\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " It is.\n",
            " Example, right?\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " It's like, like copying or like taking by example.\n",
            " Yeah, exactly.\n",
            " So benchmarking is kind of like measuring something.\n",
            " And then you can say, okay,\n",
            " I think I'm going to like, I'm going to try to say it's like,\n",
            " I don't know if it's the right word.\n",
            " I don't know if it's the right word.\n",
            " But in my head, I was like, Oh, he knows what he's talking about.\n",
            " He's talking about businesses.\n",
            " That sounds good.\n",
            " But no, it's not the right word. I don't think.\n",
            " Okay.\n",
            " So benchmarking.\n",
            " The IT companies such as.\n",
            " Google Facebook.\n",
            " Well,\n",
            " Google and Facebook.\n",
            " Okay.\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " Maybe.\n",
            " I don't know.\n",
            " Probably.\n",
            " I don't know.\n",
            " Maybe.\n",
            " Okay.\n",
            " So.\n",
            " And maybe Apple.\n",
            " So Google or Facebook.\n",
            " Okay.\n",
            " Based on learning.\n",
            " They try it.\n",
            " Okay.\n",
            " So.\n",
            " Facebook.\n",
            " So we could say.\n",
            " Emulating.\n",
            " How big it companies.\n",
            " Maybe like managed.\n",
            " Brooks.\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " Like, like managed.\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " Like, like managed.\n",
            " Yeah.\n",
            " Like, like managed.\n",
            " Yeah.\n",

            " Managed their workplaces.\n",
            " Something like that.\n",
            " Such as Google or Facebook.\n",
            " Or actually we would say that's here.\n",
            " Such as Google.\n",
            " Or Facebook.\n",
            " Managed workplaces.\n",
            " Okay.\n",
            " And then you said.\n",
            " Still, it's not easy.\n",
            " They're preparing their minds.\n",
            " Okay.\n",
            " Still, I like that.\n",
            " Still, it's.\n",
            " Still, it's not easy.\n",
            " It's.\n",
            " So instead of not easy, we could even just say it's difficult.\n",

actually i dont think im the person who could be part of them **** company like the or ********* ** company in **** for me i mean most of *** people didnt ****** think that thats ***** **** for them but you know the ********* is kind of strict ***** so i just when i preparing the college exam i thought ****** it will be great to choose the **** * major that less **** stressful i guess because it doesnt matter where i go to make money it doesnt really relate it with money ** i i can say *** that because you you could tell me like that because you have experienced that you know so you mean if i choose *** something that i dont want it will ***** be some kind unsustainable *********** i guess its a **** typical problem you know wha whats the most valuable or whats most important to just to

people making goals **** or idea that they want to be and how they looks **** like but ***** because its just a *** idea its ** really have *** some distant ******** with reality for ** real me so i always get **** pressure to to be prepared *** **** and to the idea ** ***** that i imagine of ** myself maybe its because i care ***** other peoples thinking other peoples opinion how do i look like

have that **** because actually have been ********** ****** through all some experience and just when i when i my age is increasing w *** what i realize is that ** my life and my mentality is not really hopeful like there is no no interesting thing to me so i i its its not really but ********* then that that it sound ****** like maybe maybe i need to find something could be interesting me i used to like to draw but when i started this with my co **** for my college exam once i was re prepared *** design major so i suppose *** ******** to run some for personal ****** ************ art and it turns out i it just doesnt suit with me so i lost interesting from that and you know its a typical story that you used to like it but when it become ******* your duty it doesnt really you know you almost hate it so i lost my art from my life and right now currently i ***** **** do reading ***** * were making some like just making the ******* thats my hobby maybe youre like removing your

i was younger than now * **** ** the wondering or s losing the way is most frightening thing in my life because it feels so unstable and it feels ***** *** so i try i try to avoid them but like *** right ow *** i changed my mind because if i dont wondering i mean if i dont lose my weight i dont that ***** mean i dont think about right now and i think about what im doing right now and what im gon

lose my lose the value of my what im doing i can really conveyed about this **** ** **** *** ****** to what im doing if i dont think about right now so thats what ***** i thought like that it just change changed my mind like maybe lose ** *** my weight *** isnt really bad thing on *** everything because its a chance to think about my life again and we arrange ********* my goal **** right like when i feel like dumb on myself *** it it also like my life and what im doing is kinda meaningless because i dont know is *** just is more like * feel im losing my motivation why why am i doing this like this though im just losing that and i feel wondering as well *** maybe i feel anxiety because i dont really have certain goal but **** ***** when ive when i plan my goal i **** *** feel more anxiety to me because its it feels ** *** like burden its actually ****** ********** the time **** of planning and i mean time **** of plan is longer the burden ****** is burden pressure is deeper so i just to trying to focus on right now and you know i i gained **** my weight *** ** like 10 kilogram after i got this college ** ***** ***** youre right because everyone does those are **** **** maybe maybe why * feel about my may *** ** the thing is that i the many people living their lives their ******* *** life ***** *** like thats most important thing their life in their life like collegester ******* for the jobster they just *** ***** ** focus on that *** and if they loved it i mean they they it ****** like theyre like people **** in why why **** i feel about meaningless ******** ** ** life its ** because of that since i that maybe ** *** we we all know about the what what **** ***** is happiness and what kind of thing could bring us happening ********* the taking

********* like the literally the acting of pursuing their happiness **** ******* its kind of weird because pursuing and we just we can only pursuing happiness ******** but that ** doesnt make us **

its literally the acting of happiness like i dont know what im trying to get i i heard that dont you feel like since you told me youre **** kind of ***** with perfect *** **** so because if impossible

i pay more for the principal that was very interesting so if i pay for *** is actually i am ** paying the interest ********* about 66 five *** £500 right now like that for those *** 65 of mortgage that is con that consists of £10 ** *** of repayment ********** the rest is or are interest ********** but if my times go or if as time goes by the repayment will be the it will further ****** *** ***

like i mean for one of my company i need to make * **** ** **** a deal structure *** of that target company with another company in terms of the joint development agreement and in **** the case ** **** **** i need to in **** the case i need to make the target company and another company involved in the conversation about how to build up the how to build up the joint development structure so in that case i need to facilitate the meeting and then i need to make them to be more **** * **** make them happy about the ****** reserves of the negotiation of what theyre doing so i need to facilitate and i need to support ***** the word the process about negotiation basically ***** and so thats my daily routine basically i need to meet up many partners and then talk with them ********** conversation with them and then make sure that they do both understand the work correctly and that they do **** get the benefit from each other by structuring the deal by ** setting up the deal structure so thats what i am generally doing for my routine job so basically it ******* requires a lot of communication and conversation between and among the parties so basically sometimes like *** **** your one party just feel that the *** deal structure is too *** to like * you mean beneficial only to one party while another party gets a lot of disadvantages so i need to make sure that the deal structure is both beneficial to both parties so that they can get into the deal structure easily because like i mean generally in the business structure they need to be convinced by the deal structure and they need to also convince for example there their **** boats with **** the deer structure unless theyre convinced with the **** deer structure they can not persuade their like instead of **** both or their leader they can not **** *** *** ******** appreciate their time management with the **** deer structure so i have * **** to make sure the deal structure i have to make sure to ********** converse eight that the **** deer structure is both beneficial to both companies so ** it involves a lot of conversation basically so basically both are ******* cracked so since i am investment **** farm im working for the investment **** farm so ** there are like * **** two ways of dealing with the target company after we invest into the company we deal with the company as the board member so generally a lot of like i mean important decision will be made by *** board so we bring the topic to the board members which he is generally i mean and then they need to approve about the actions ** are actions that we try to make for example like i mean some kind of partnership between ******* the target company and another company so it involves the *** ********** appreciation of the board member of the target company it also involves the ********** appreciation of the like partnership company so that they can get involved with *** a partnership with the target company so there are like i mean diverse layer basically that i need to get in so sometimes i just let them know this is some work that you can do you can do it and then sometimes target company just do it and then sometimes if target company can not work only by themselves well then i have to be get i have to be involved more and then let them work on the structure can you please repeat the question again so basically it is not about it is more it is not about negotiation character it is more about the personal character what you have described so im basically my personal character is not really aggressive i just try to listen a lot from the like partners and **** i ***** try to mitigate the **** city i * ***** try to understand the situation and i tried to facilitate the *** relationship between two parties and i understand there are some other people who are more aggressive and they who are trying to persuade others by aggressively pushing ******* their opinion but im not *** that kind of person im not i dont have that kind of personal character so i try so my personal character is more like listening more **** than trying to understand what their concern is and then trying to mitigate their ******* concerns and then trying to find out the *** deal structure by mitigating their ******** *** concern we can move on sure *** by the way are you i mean for the casual conversation are you currently living in florida in miami great ive been there before and then it was great city for sure no not really i * mean i was in us almost 15 years ago and then i stayed in the new york city as a grad student in the chemistry department i * finished my phd in the new york city so ** at the time i was young and then i just visited you know miami key west ******* glory that area like me i **** * think it was like i mean one week travel so it was only my experience of the florida and then *** **** since i was almost like 25 years old at the time it was like 15 years ago and i was really happily enjoyed the *** ** *** *** sea like environment of the florida especially like key west orlando not specifically miami unfortunately i * mean so ** i mean currently im working with the target company in california in the san jose area in the silicon valley so i know a lot about like * in new york i mean like east you eastern part ******* is that part of the ** u s and the western part of the ** u s but im not that familiar with like a texas houston florida like a certain ***** part of the ** u s im not that familiar with the culture ***** ** of their and frankly speaking *** *** so you can you ******* first explain maybe the difference between *** eastern part and *** i * am also kind of ******** formula with the northern part of the ** u s because i actually lived in toronto previously for a year so but i have no experience of the you know like i mean just ******* **** living expect experience in ** southern part of the ** u s so if you can explain it would be really great *** **** **** ******* florida is there is *** a city i * do not remember exactly which city ** was ** there like i mean a lot of people like the *** retired people they **** go to florida and then they live there and then there was *** i ****** felt that the name of the city in the florida and then that city is pretty famous with the retired people coming in and then the city is also famous with really expensive real estate asset i forgot the name it is around the miami but it is not really exactly miami i dont really remember ** anymore ** ***** ***** ********* someone broke the miami sure so ** i mean so in frankly speaking i dont really i mean for the vacation like i dont agree going to us as my vacation basically my ** wife ***** she always wanted to go to us **** ** for the vacation but ** frankly speaking is **** **** really close it ** costs a lot and then like i mean as a single i * mean * **** *** *** *** youre a single i guess and then *** **** like i mean there is difference like i mean when i was single if i go to like i mean if i travel to some place i * need to pay only for my for one travel ****** ticket and **** then i could ****** stay ** * you know cheap hotel it was possible but since i do have my wife and my ** daughter i need to pay for like * three people ****** fried like three people like * **** ***** ****** air fright and then like you know i **** * need to pay for ** at least * good enough hotel not the ****** hotel so ** it costs a lot ** and frankly speaking and then *** **** i mean for me vacation is i love ********* troubling so but ** frankly speaking us is not that *** **** exotic to me us is more like somewhere i have visited previously ** ******* ** if i have any chance or time to go for ****** a trouble i will choose europe or other ***** places of the world instead of us ** and frankly speaking because ** us like ***** *** *** ***** theyre adapting much for me to enjoy anymore like everything i have done it done previously so youre right so previously so ** for i mean giving you my more background i so i ******* started in japan for like several months and then i studied in toronto for a year and then afterwards i went to new york city for my grad school for five years so thats where *** ** over my education story and then during that time i went to you know australia or europe for just vacation at the time and then after i came back to korea i went to many southeast asian countries including india is not really southeastern asia but anyway so ** * ***** again it was my leisure and then after i get married and then after i got kind of like me moved not *** really promoted but maybe *** trying after i moved a lot ** in the ** *** **** farm like i mean so my general role is basically investing and then making new business and then like i mean those kind of things so ** generally i do have a lot of international **** ***** works so for us i go there like i mean almost every two months or a month and then *** **** to the silicon valley i stayed there like one or two weeks whenever i visited there so ** currently instead of really traveling i do have a lot of business **** trips so ** but still i * about like you know traveling alone its not really possible anymore so i do love traveling and then but *** like i mean nowadays i have small kids so i have to take care of her all the time ** its not traveling its like you know *** ****** they carry in different area of the world so so i think last year like around september ** ******* * ** rock too right august or ********* reception but i * started to move around the world again and then as you have mentioned ** during the covid time for almost *** *** *** *** **** 41 15 year i was not really moving around ** *** the door i **** always stayed ****** in south korea so during **** the time it was conducted remote i mean but ***** like generally youre right ** *** **** **** sure so sure so ** ** its very practical question basically that i am always doing so before i meet the partner i always think about what will be the **** what will be **** with the possible scenarios i try to think about it think it through i think it through and then trying to you know ** try to write down *** where the possible scenarios that **** *** the deal could be made and then *** **** but i never tried to show them to the partner before partner show what their intention is and then after ******* **** partners showed their intention and then at that time i * am giving them *** card that i have prepared some of the ***** card so ** basically so for the scenario planning i try to think about **** *** world of different kinds of scenarios that i can think of and then after i make a contact with *** a partner ** i ***** try to how to say i tried to try to ** or hi forgotten me i forgot the **** * ****** *** word again i tried to ** ** i try to accommodate to the partners intention so ** thats something that im doing generally like i mean so generally for the negotiation and **** the you know ** *** really business in a business way so its not just one i mean business generally include multiple opportunities so whenever like the partner ****** they are not just one time ******* partners they are like i mean i forgot the word again **** *** there like i mean concurrent ** were upcoming or they are like i mean see in a ** ** * series of the partner i get the one *** i need i *** cant negotiate i can have * many different business with one partner in a different timeline i forgot what the right word is re occurring so ** i need to make a *********** ******** **** re occurring partners so instead of taking *** *** word opportunities at one business deal i try to maximize the *** benefit for both of the parties for * long ****** periods of time like its just building up their relationship it is the one of the most important thing in * business or in a negotiation i think negotiation is not so ** like even if ** i am negotiating with *** a partner who i * consider is just one time partner then ******* *** it will be very hard but like giving them the benefit and giving them the *** * ****** *** high production name again not *** just ******* benefits giving them the ***** case upper hand giving them the upper hand i can make the next opportunities with him with **** the partner sorry the question ** was pretty hard for me to can you please repeat again **** ** its not really tangible question ** its more how to say its more sophisticated ******** ** questions i was not able to understand it well can you please repeat the first part of the sentence i see so when two partners are really upset with each other you mean so in **** the case it is not really possible so there might be *** a good personnel who is *** ** * our good negotiator so who **** **** **** *** can deal with the upset partners but im not **** the kind of person im trying to you know making up so ** ** *** under i mean so ** for the negotiation in my opinion **** the *** ground rule the term rule is that partner is supposed to consider other partner as the business partner as a friend or as a as * like a business partner but if someone hate each other or if someone is upset with each other it is not ********* really easy for them to make * gesture like i mean gesture for the opportunities it is not possible so i dont think i was ever be involved in that kind of situation at *** work previously i mean right so intense ** its different with the upset ** were mad with each **** other like intense means like i mean so ** emotionally someone could be i mean ********* emotion so the ******** partner is supposed to **** no there is opportunity in a business so merger is not just like * **** when one company ***** emerged another company the target company gets benefit of the money and the investing company gets ******* benefits by taking the *** so what **** majority or the control controlling power of the target company so both ****** parties supposed to have the benefit by action but in that case the *** negotiation could get intense *** but both parties understand that finally they need to get to the answer or ** finally they need to greet each other with the *** what the *** tangible ******* reserve in that case on even though the *** communication could get intense they never let another person another party get upset i mean that when the party *** gets upset it means they do not consider another party as the good partner in that case the partner can not be made so generally for the investment so ** the *** investment **** fund consider the ceo as the really good ** i asked the really consider **** ceo tendency as really important because like * you mean if the ceo doesnt seem *** feed with *** investment **** bond investment company **** done investment company do not consider they can invest into that target company because ******* acquisition could happen at just single time it but afterwards they have to work for at least ***** ** **** 35 or seven ***** ** until they sell the target company it involves like i mean *********** re occurring partnership between target company and the investment company so if someone makes if one partner make upset another partner then generally do not make the transition * **** * and transaction so its simply not possible they have to have **** **** ** **** a belief that they another partner is a partner who can give trust **** who is more trustworthy no this is basically my ****** first job after i came to korea so i previously worked for ******* *** some song p c g lg currently i am in sk and then they are ***** were like * **** a big company in korea or in ***** work so i have pretty diversified experience i it ***** ranged from the i started as the researcher but now i *********** transit to the **** business personnel like i mean not only negotiator or ******* analysis about the target company and then trying to facilitate and then was a facilitator so yes that is who i am how did i transit my background to the business industry *** **** so basically i studied in the columbia university did my phd in columbia university in the city of new york city and then afterwards so i came to ******* some song in korea working worked as a researcher for three years but i was not only worked as a researcher at the time i was like i mean more about the facilitator between the university and the company so i ********** facility i was like * **** trying to you know managing the project between the university and the company and then i also of course i also write down wrote down my thesis my papers during also during while i was in company and then but *** since i studied in new york city there were like many a lot of distraction basically from the like * you mean there were like many ******* finest area people and then also the graduate from my lab they went like some of the people went to goldman ***** socks and then *** **** like there were so many distractions so i was **** always interested in those **** kinds of business area so i ******* fight for the bcg which is the ********* strategy consulting company and then after working over there and then ** after i graduate from that ********** concert ng group even though since i do have my background as a phd you know chemistry i do have good knowledge **** ********* of the technology and then i *** ****** cant really so its *** like using its like ******* converse its like having two different languages like i mean i can speak with us people i can speak with korean people i can speak with engineering people i can speak with business people so business people they rely on me about *** technology generally so ** technology perspective so i try to give them or whether that the *** company has good technology background or not i * give them those **** kinds of advice and then there is a value that i can provide to the investment **** fund so ** that is who i am basically i * so ** i have to of course work with many finance people to understand the *** ********** *** projection financial ********** projection basically but also i do have my strong background ** you know technology so thats why ***** because how i transit my ** experience my *** sure thank you so much i really appreciate all your time and **** that it was * really enjoyable time for me so i hope you **** had like a successful life **** or so afterwards i mean i really thank you for all your feedback and then you know and your conversation with me thank you so much\n",
            "i am good hi ** ** how are you for sure hi my name is im sorry for for this like * hassle right now im trying to set up the the phone call and then my name is *** my basic english skill is not at beginner im kinda fond **** ** ****** and the reason why i decided to take the class was just to make sure that for me like *** english is i need to speak english very fondly ******** instead of like i mean **** * for me for me like a casual conversation is pretty easy because i lived in us previously but like i mean since i am living ******* i am working for the investment firm **** i need to conversate ******** ** with like a *** target company in us or in in any other country and i need to speak with them all in more in business way or in a in a proficient way or **** in a how to say in more elegant way so thats the reason why i decided to take the class and and just to let you know i know like in many teachers they try to they are kinda **** ** immersed in typing something after i converse ********* a lot so in i mean right now im using my cell phone so i can not read the writing that you write on your computer so you i mean unless it is really necessary or for you or **** unless it is the requirement for you dont have to type everything that im saying or youre **** rephrasing instead you just you just talk it loud and then i will listen and then and you dont have to be immersed in that kind of work too much and secondly like i mean i may speak a lot so so instead of and then and then sometimes i may say i dont know what to say and then you can just ** you know you can simply interrupt and then you can if you have any idea and you can just give me a good word for for example previously i have said i wanted to speak in more business way or in a proficient way or in a ** elegant way and in that case you can like rephrase you can toss me some word ***** which is really good for that context like *** ** you know what i mean you can just interrupt me in that way so you dont have to wait until i finish my conversation so so basically ill * **** just follow your lead so whatever is convenient for you i will just follow so yes to just to ***** just one moment * ***** * *** **** **** ** so right now im in in the home so in home wife ** **** and my baby is walking around and then in frankly speaking i didnt have the time to read the the article so instead of you know giving me those kind of like prestudy question *** ***** ********* so please give me something else that i dont have to read the text or or like i mean the prestudy * *** ***** ******** **** *** ***** so since my job is basically investment work *** and then i am so so it is only the part of the job and another job is i need to value up my target company where we have invested in to do that i need to deal ***** i need to work with many many cooperators where i need to work with many partners so so like i mean in that case there are like i mean so for example like i mean *** one of my company i need to make i need to make a deal structure for ** that target company with another company in terms of the joint development agreement and in that *** case in that case i need to in that *** case i need to make the target company and another company involved in the conversation about how to build up the how to build up the joint development structure so in that case i need to facilitate the meeting and then i need to make them to be more like i mean make them happy about the result ******** of the negotiation of what theyre doing so i need to facilitate and i need to support where the **** *** process about negotiation basically uhhuh and so thats my daily routine basically i need to meet up many partners and then talk with them conversate ************ with them and then make sure that they do both understand the work correctly and that they do both get the benefit from each other by structuring the deal by by setting up the deal structure so thats what i am generally doing for my routine job so basically it require ******** a lot of communication and conversation between and among the parties so basically sometimes like you know **** one party just feel that the the deal structure is too too ** like i *** mean beneficial only to one party while another party gets a lot of disadvantages so i need to make sure that the deal structure is both beneficial to both parties so that they can get into the deal structure easily because like i mean generally in the business structure they need to be convinced by the deal structure and they need to also convince for example ***** their boss ***** with deal *** **** structure unless theyre convinced with the deal **** structure they can not persuade their like instead of boss **** or their leader they can not they can not persuade ********** their time management with the deal **** structure so i have i have to make sure the deal structure i have to make sure to conversate ******** ***** that the deal **** structure is both beneficial to both companies so so it involves a lot of conversation basically so basically both are correct ******* so since i am investment firm **** im working for the investment firm **** so so there are like i mean two ways of dealing with the target company after we invest into the company we deal with the company as the board member so generally a lot of like i mean important decision will be made by the board so we bring the topic to the board members which ** is generally i mean and then they need to approve about the actions or *** actions that we try to make for example like i mean some kind of partnership between between the target company and another company so it involves the the persuasion ************ of the board member of the target company it also involves the persuasion ************ of the like partnership company so that they can get involved with the * partnership with the target company so there are like i mean diverse layer basically that i need to get in so sometimes i just let them know this is some work that you can do *** *** ** it and then sometimes target company just do it and then sometimes if target company can not work only by themselves well then i have to be get i have to be involved more and then let them work on the structure can you please repeat the question again so basically it is not about it is more it is not about negotiation character it is more about the personal character what you have described so im basically my personal character is not really aggressive i just try to listen a lot from the like partners and then i tried *** to mitigate the situ **** i i tried *** to understand the situation and i tried to facilitate the the relationship

do have my background as a phd you know chemistry i do have good knowledge good knowledge of the technology and then i can relate **** ****** so its its like using its like convers ******** its like having two different languages like i mean i can speak with us people i can speak with korean people i can speak with engineering people i can speak with business people so business people they rely

            "* ** **** hi im hi how are you? *** sure. hi my name is im sorry for *** this like a hassle right now im trying to set up the *** phone call and then my name is nam. my basic english

instead of like i mean form a for me *** ** like a casual conversation is pretty easy because i lived in us previously but like i mean since i am ****** leaving i am working for the investment **** farm i need to ********** converse it with **** * the target company in us or in ** any other country *** i need to speak with them all in more in business way or in a ** * proficient way ** were in a how to say in more elegant way. so thats the reason why i decided to take the class and *** just to let you know i know like in many teachers they try to they are ***** kind of immersed in typing something after i ******** conversed a lot. so ** i mean right now im using my cell phone so i can not read the writing that you write on your computer. so you i mean unless it is really necessary ** for *** ** your unless it is the requirement for you dont have to type everything that im saying or ***** your rephrasing instead you just *** **** talk it loud and then i will listen and then and you

no you **** *** can simply interrupt and then you can if you have any idea and you can just give me a good word for *** example previously i have said i wanted to speak in more business way or in a proficient way or in * an elegant way and in that case you can like rephrase you can toss me some **** words which is really good for that context. **** get me you **** **** * **** *** can just interrupt me in that. *** so you dont have to wait until i finish my conversation so ** basically *** i will just follow your lead so whatever is convenient for you i will just follow so *** ** just ** thats just *** ****** a woman i was just told me so right now im in ** the home so in home **** so five and my baby is walking around. and **** ** frankly speaking i didnt have *** time to read the *** article so instead of you know giving me those kind of like ******** ******** pre study questions so please give me something else that i dont have to read the text or ** like * **** *** ******** a pre study reaching cars pre study. so since my job is basically investment **** for and then i am so ** it is only the part of the job *** another job is i need to value up my target company where we have invested in to do that. i need to **** still i need to work with many **** cooperators where i need to work with many partners. so ** like i mean in that case there are like i mean so for example like i mean for one of my company i need to make * **** ** **** a deal structure *** of that target company with another company in terms of the joint development agreement and in **** the case ** **** **** i need to in **** the case i need to make the target company and another company involved in the conversation about how to build up the how to build up the joint development structure. so in that case i need to facilitate the meeting and then i need to make them to be more **** * **** make them happy about the ****** reserves of the negotiation of what theyre doing. so i need to facilitate and i need to support ***** the word the process about negotiation basically. ***** and so thats my daily routine basically i need to meet up many partners and then talk with them ********** conversation with them and then make sure that they do both understand the work correctly and that they do **** get the benefit from each other by structuring the deal by ** setting up the deal structure. so thats what i am generally doing for my routine job. so basically it ******* requires a lot of communication and conversation between and among the parties. so basically sometimes like *** **** your one party just feel that the *** deal structure is too *** to like * you mean beneficial only to one party while another party gets a lot of disadvantages. so i need to make sure that the deal structure is both beneficial to both parties so that they can get into the deal structure easily because like i mean generally in the business structure they need to be convinced by the deal structure and they need to also convince for example there their **** boats with **** the deer structure unless theyre convinced with the **** deer structure. they can not persuade their like instead of **** both or their leader they can not **** *** *** ******** appreciate their time management with the **** deer structure. so i have * **** to make sure the deal structure i have to make sure to ********** converse eight that the **** deer structure is both beneficial to both companies. so ** it involves a lot of conversation basically so basically both are ******* cracked. so since i am investment **** farm im working for the investment **** farm. so ** there are like * **** two ways of dealing with the target company after we invest into the company. we deal with the company as the board member. so generally a lot of like i mean important decision will be made by *** board so we bring the topic to the board members which he is generally i mean and then they need to approve about the actions ** are actions that we try to make. for example like i mean some kind of partnership between ******* the target company and another company. so it involves the *** ********** appreciation of the board member of the target company. it also involves the ********** appreciation of the like partnership company so that they can get involved with *** a partnership with the target company. so there are like i mean diverse layer basically that i need to get in. so sometimes i just let them know this is some work that you can do you can do it and then sometimes target company just do it. and then sometimes if target company can not work only by themselves well then i have to be get i have to be involved more and then let them work on the structure. can you please repeat the question again so basically it is not about it is more it is not about negotiation character it is more about the personal character what you have described. so im basically my personal character is not really aggressive. i just try to listen a lot from the like partners and **** i ***** try to mitigate the **** city. i * ***** try to understand the situation and i tried to facilitate the *** relationship between two parties. and i understand there are some other people who are more aggressive and they who are trying to persuade others by aggressively pushing ******* their opinion. but im not *** that kind of person. im not i dont have that kind of personal character. so i try so my personal character is more like listening more **** than trying to understand what their concern is and then trying to mitigate their ******* concerns and then trying to find out the *** deal structure by mitigating their ******** *** concern. we can move on. sure. *** by the way are you i mean for the casual conversation are you currently living in florida in miami? great. ive been there before and then it was great city for sure. no not really. i * mean i was in us almost 15 years ago and then i stayed in the new york city as a grad student in the chemistry department. i * finished my phd in the new york city. so ** at the time i was young and then i just visited you know miami key west ******* glory that area like me. i **** * think it was like i mean one week travel. so it was only my experience of the florida and then *** **** since i was almost like 25 years old at the time it was like 15 years ago and i was really happily enjoyed the *** ** *** *** sea like environment of the florida especially like key west orlando not specifically miami. unfortunately i * mean so ** i mean currently im working with the target company in california in the san jose area in the silicon valley. so i know a lot about like * in new york. i mean like east you eastern part ******* is that part of the ** u s and the western part of the ** u s but im not that familiar with like a texas houston florida like a certain ***** part of the ** u s im not that familiar with the culture ***** ** of their and frankly speaking *** *** so you can you ******* first explain maybe the difference between *** eastern part and *** i * am also kind of ******** formula with the northern part of the ** u s because i actually lived in toronto previously for a year. so but i have no experience of the you know like i mean just ******* **** living expect experience in ** southern part of the ** u s so if you can explain it would be really great *** **** **** ******* florida is there is *** a city i * do not remember exactly which city ** was ** there. like i mean a lot of people like the *** retired people they **** go to florida and then they live there and then there was *** i ****** felt that the name of the city in the florida and then that city is pretty famous with the retired people coming in and then the city is also famous with really expensive real estate asset i forgot the name it is around the miami but it is not really exactly miami i dont really remember ** anymore. ** ***** ***** ********* someone broke the miami sure. so ** i mean so in frankly speaking i dont really i mean for the vacation like i dont agree going to us as my vacation basically my ** wife ***** she always wanted to go to us **** ** for the vacation but ** frankly speaking is **** **** really close it ** costs a lot and then like i mean as a single i * mean * **** *** *** *** youre a single i guess and then *** **** like i mean there is difference like i mean when i was single if i go to like i mean if i travel to some place i * need to pay only for my for one travel ****** ticket and **** then i could ****** stay ** * you know cheap hotel it was possible but since i do have my wife and my ** daughter i need to pay for like * three people ****** fried like three people like * **** ***** ****** air fright and then like you know i **** * need to pay for ** at least * good enough hotel not the ****** hotel so ** it costs a lot ** and frankly speaking and then *** **** i mean for me vacation is i love ********* troubling so but ** frankly speaking us is not that *** **** exotic to me us is more like somewhere i have visited previously. ** ******* ** if i have any chance or time to go for ****** a trouble i will choose europe or other ***** places of the world instead of us. ** and frankly speaking because ** us like ***** *** *** ***** theyre adapting much for me to enjoy anymore like everything i have done it done previously so. youre right. so previously so ** for i mean giving you my more background i so i ******* started in japan for like several months and then i studied in toronto for a year and then afterwards i went to new york city for my grad school for five years. so thats where *** ** over my education story and then during that time i went to you know australia or europe for just vacation at the time. and then after i came back to korea i went to many southeast asian countries including india is not really southeastern asia. but anyway so ** * ***** again it was my leisure and then after i get married and then after i got kind of like me moved not *** really promoted but maybe *** trying after i moved a lot ** in the ** *** **** farm like i mean so my general role is basically investing and then making new business and then like i mean those kind of things. so ** generally i do have a lot of international **** ***** works. so for us i go there like i mean almost every two months or a month. and then *** **** to the silicon valley i stayed there like one or two weeks whenever i visited there. so ** currently instead of really traveling i do have a lot of business **** trips. so ** but still i * about like you know traveling alone its not really possible anymore. so i do love traveling and then but *** like i mean nowadays i have small kids so i have to take care of her all the time. ** its not traveling. its like you know *** ****** they carry in different area of the world. so so i think last year like around september ** ******* * ** rock too. right august or ********* reception but i * started to move around the world again. and then as you have mentioned ** during the covid time for almost *** *** *** *** **** 41 15 year i was not really moving around ** *** the door. i **** always stayed ****** in south korea. so during **** the time it was conducted remote i mean but ***** like generally youre right. ** *** **** **** sure. so sure. so ** ** its very practical question basically that i am always doing so before i meet the partner i always think about what will be the **** what will be **** with the possible scenarios. i try to think about it think it through i think it through. and then trying to you know ** try to write down *** where the possible scenarios that **** *** the deal could be made and then *** **** but i never tried to show them to the partner before partner show what their intention is and then after ******* **** partners showed their intention and then at that time i * am giving them *** card that i have prepared some of the ***** card. so ** basically so for the scenario planning i try to think about **** *** world of different kinds of scenarios that i can think of and then after i make a contact with *** a partner ** i ***** try to how to say i tried to try to ** or hi forgotten me i forgot the **** * ****** *** word again. i tried to ** ** i try to accommodate to the partners intention. so ** thats something that im doing generally. like i mean so generally for the negotiation and **** the you know ** *** really business in a business way. so its not just one i mean business generally include multiple opportunities. so whenever like the partner ****** they are not just one time ******* partners they are like i mean i forgot the word again **** *** there like i mean concurrent ** were upcoming or they are like i mean see in a ** ** * series of the partner i get the one *** i need i *** cant negotiate i can have * many different business with one partner in a different timeline. i forgot what the right word is re occurring. so ** i need to make a *********** ******** **** re occurring partners. so instead of taking *** *** word opportunities at one business deal i try to maximize the *** benefit for both of the parties for * long ****** periods of time. like its just building up their relationship. it is the one of the most important thing in * business or in a negotiation. i think negotiation is not. so ** like even if ** i am negotiating with *** a partner who i * consider is just one time partner then ******* *** it will be very hard but like giving them the benefit and giving them the *** * ****** *** high production name again? not *** just ******* benefits giving them the ***** case upper hand giving them the upper hand. i can make the next opportunities with him with **** the partner. sorry the question ** was pretty hard for me to can you please repeat again? **** ** its not really tangible question. ** its more how to say its more sophisticated ******** ** questions i was not able to understand it. well can you please repeat the first part of the sentence i see? so when two partners are really upset with each other you mean? so in **** the case it is not really possible. so there might be *** a good personnel who is *** ** * our good negotiator. so who **** **** **** *** can deal with the upset partners. but im not **** the kind of person. im trying to you know making up. so ** ** *** under i mean so ** for the negotiation in my opinion **** the *** ground rule the term rule is that partner is supposed to consider other partner as the business partner as a friend or as a as * like a business partner. but if someone hate each other or if someone is upset with each other it is not ********* really easy for them to make * gesture. like i mean gesture for the opportunities. it is not possible. so i dont think i was ever be involved in that kind of situation at *** work previously. i mean. right. so intense. ** its different with the upset ** were mad with each **** other. like intense means like i mean so ** emotionally someone could be i mean ********* emotion. so the ******** partner is supposed to **** no there is opportunity in a business. so merger is not just like * **** when one company ***** emerged another company the target company gets benefit of the money and the investing company gets ******* benefits by taking the *** so what **** majority or the control controlling power of the target company. so both ****** parties supposed to have the benefit by action. but in that case the *** negotiation could get intense. *** but both parties understand that finally they need to get to the answer or ** finally they need to greet each other with the *** what the *** tangible ******* reserve in that case on even though the *** communication could get intense they never let another person another party get upset. i mean that when the party *** gets upset it means they do not consider another party as the good partner. in that case the partner can not be made so generally for the investment. so ** the *** investment **** fund consider the ceo as the really good. ** i asked the really consider **** ceo tendency as really important because like * you mean if the ceo doesnt seem *** feed with *** investment **** bond investment company **** done investment company do not consider they can invest into that target company because ******* acquisition could happen at just single time it but afterwards they have to work for at least ***** ** **** 35 or seven ***** ** until they sell the target company. it involves like i mean *********** re occurring partnership between target company and the investment company. so if someone makes if one partner make upset another partner then generally do not make the transition * **** * and transaction. so its simply not possible. they have to have **** **** ** **** a belief that they another partner is a partner who can give trust **** who is more trustworthy. no this is basically my ****** first job after i came to korea. so i previously worked for ******* *** some song p c g lg. currently i am in sk and then they are ***** were like * **** a big company in korea or in ***** work. so i have pretty diversified experience. i it ***** ranged from the i started as the researcher but now i *********** transit to the **** business personnel like i mean not only negotiator or ******* analysis about the target company and then trying to facilitate and then was a facilitator. so yes that is who i am how did i transit my background to the business industry? *** **** so basically i studied in the columbia university did my phd in columbia university in the city of new york city and then afterwards so i came to ******* some song in korea working worked as a researcher for three years. but i was not only worked as a researcher at the time i was like i mean more about the facilitator between the university and the company. so i ********** facility i was like * **** trying to you know managing the project between the university and the company. and then i also of course i also write down wrote down my thesis my papers during also during while i was in company and then but *** since i studied in new york city there were like many a lot of distraction basically from the like * you mean there were like many ******* finest area people and then also the graduate from my lab they went like some of the people went to goldman ***** socks. and then *** **** like there were so many distractions. so i was **** always interested in those **** kinds of business area. so i ******* fight for the bcg which is the ********* strategy consulting company and then after working over there and then ** after i graduate from that ********** concert ng group even though since i do have my background as a phd you know chemistry i do have good knowledge **** ********* of the technology and then i *** ****** cant really so its *** like using its like ******* converse its like having two different languages like i mean i can speak with us people i can speak with korean people i can speak with engineering people i can speak with business people so business people they rely on me about *** technology generally. so ** technology perspective so i try to give them or whether that the *** company has good technology background or not i * give them those **** kinds of advice and then there is a value that i can provide to the investment **** fund. so ** that is who i am basically i * so ** i have to of course work with many finance people to understand the *** ********** *** projection financial ********** projection basically. but also i do have my strong background ** you know technology so thats why ***** because how i transit my ** experience my *** sure. thank you so much. i really appreciate all your time and **** that it was * really enjoyable

they are ***** like i mean concurrent or **** upcoming or they are like i mean *** in a se in a series of the partner i get the one but i need i can **** negotiate i can have a many different business with one partner in a different timeline. i forgot what the right word is ** *********. so so i need to make a reoccurring business with ** ********* partners. so instead of taking all the **** opportunities at one business deal i try to maximize the the benefit for both of the parties for a long period ******* of time. like *** just building up their relationship. it is the one of the most important thing in a business or in a negotiation. i think negotiation is not. so so like **** if if i am negotiating with the * partner who i i consider is just one time partner then usually its ** **** ** very hard *** like giving them the benefit and giving them the the i forgot the **** ********** name again? not not just benefit ******** giving them the taste **** upper hand giving them *** upper hand. i can make the next opportunities with him with with the partner. sorry the question is *** pretty hard for me to can you please repeat again? this is *** not really tangible question. is *** more how to say its more sophisticated question so ********* i was not able to understand it. well can you please repeat the first part of the sentence i see? so when two partners are really upset with each other you mean? so in that *** case it is not really possible. so there might be the * good personnel who is who is a *** good negotiator. so who cant deal with who can deal with the upset partners. but im not that *** kind of person. im trying to you know making up. so so on the ***** i mean so so for the negotiation in my opinion like the the ground rule *** **** **** is that partner is supposed to consider other partner as the business partner as a friend or as a as a like * business partner. but if someone hate each other or if someone is upset with each other it is not generally ****** easy for them to make a gesture. like i mean gesture for the opportunities. it is not possible. so i dont think i was ever be involved in that kind of situation at all **** previously. i mean. right. so intense. is *** different with the upset or **** mad with each each other. like intense means like i mean so so emotionally someone could be i mean emotional *******. so the partners ******* ** supposed to know ** there is opportunity in a business. so merger is not just like i mean when one company merge ******* another company the target company gets benefit of the money and the investing company gets benefit ******** by taking the the ** what what majority or the control controlling power of the target company. so both partys ******* supposed to have the benefit by ******. but in that case the the negotiation could get intense. for *** both parties understand that finally they need to get to the answer or we finally they need to greet each other with the the what the the tangible results ******* in that case on even though the the communication could get intense they never let another person another party get upset. i mean that when the party get **** upset it means they do not consider another party as the good partner. in that case the partner can not be made so generally for the investment. so so the the investment firm **** consider the ceo as the really good. as * ***** the really consider ceos *** tendency as really important because like i *** mean if the ceo doesnt seem fit **** with the investment firm **** investment company then **** investment company do not consider they can invest into that target company because because acquisition could happen at just single time ** but afterwards they have to work for at least three to five ** or seven years on until they sell the target company. it involves like i mean reoccurring ** ********* partnership between target company and *** investment company. so if someone makes if one partner make upset another partner then generally do not make the transition i mean a *** transaction. so its simply not possible. they have to have they have to have a belief that they another partner is a partner who can give trust this *** is **** ***********. ** this is basically my fourth ***** job after i came to korea. so i previously worked for samsung bcg **** **** * * * lg. currently i am in ** and then they are where **** like i mean * big company in korea or in world ****. so i have pretty diversified experience. i it range ****** from the i started as the researcher but now i transferred ******* to the like business personnel like i mean not only negotiator or analyst ******** about the target company and then trying to facilitate and then was a facilitator. so yes that is who i am how did i transit my background to the business industry? you mean so basically i studied in the columbia university did my phd in columbia university in the city of new york city and then afterwards so i came to samsung **** **** in korea working worked as a researcher for three years. but i was not only worked as a researcher at the time i was like i mean more about the facilitator between the university and the company. so i personally ******** i was like i mean trying to you know managing the project between the university and the company. and then i also of course i also write down wrote down my thesis my papers during also during while i was in company and then but but since i studied in new york city there were like many a lot of distraction basically from the like i *** mean there were like many finance ****** area people and then also the graduate from my lab they went like some of the people went to goldman sachs *****. and then and then like there were so many distractions. so i was also ****** interested in those kind ***** of business area. so i applied ***** for the bcg which is the strategic ******** consulting company and then after working over there and then af after i graduate from that consulting ******* ** group even though since i do have my background as a phd you know chemistry i do have good knowledge good knowledge of the technology and then i can relate **** ****** so its its like using its like convers ******** its like having two different languages like i mean i can speak with us people i can speak with korean people i can speak with engineering people i can speak with business people so business people they rely on me about the technology generally. so so technology perspective so i try to give them or whether **** the the company has good technology background or not i i give them those kind ***** of advice and then there is a value that i can provide to the investment firm ****. so so that is who i am basically i i so so i have to of course work with many finance people to understand the the protection the ********** financial protection ********** basically. but also i do have my strong background in *** **** technology so thats why thats ******* how i transit my my experience my job sure. thank you so much. i really appreciate all your time and then **** it was a really enjoyable time for me. so i hope you have *** like * successful life also ** ** afterwards. i mean i really thank you for all your feedback and then you know and your conversation with me. thank you so much.\n",

there are a lot of money in the united states is very well known that the fed is printing a lot of money so everyone is thinking that americans must be rich because the fed ***** ** ** is printing

yes i am ** aware of that actually the united states and *** many european countries tried to sanction russia but it seems that it failed big and now since the russia is winning the game the rubles value is going up going up and the countries who have sanctioned russia are now well suffering more it sounds cool backfired **** *** **** **** ***** **** i think this time it is different because

******* *** and also because of the growing renewable energy narrative it is systematically going high the traditional commodity prices like oil and gas but what russia ** russias main export items are those **** ******* so i think a ruble ****** valuation is main ***** *** ****** ****** from this ***** commodities so or ** this time every sanction every activity can not be succeeded because of

******* ***** **** *** ******* system systematically sounds ***** too much engineering ** * **** ** i used that term because i didnt think i dont think this mmh the lies ****** is not just an ** event

if the united states just block ******* that network **** then **** i can not use my money even though i have a lot of us dollar i can not use that so i think thats somehow creating many other issues
